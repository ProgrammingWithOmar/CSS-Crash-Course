## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a web page. It plays a crucial role in web development by separating the structure (HTML) from the design (CSS) of a web page.

## Why is CSS Important?

CSS is essential in web development for several reasons:

- Enhances the visual appeal and user experience of websites.
- Allows precise control over the styling of web content.
- Provides versatility in designing and formatting web elements.

## CSS Syntax and Structure

CSS rules have a specific syntax and structure:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
  /* More properties and values */
}
```

- `selector`: Identifies which HTML elements the style should be applied to.
- `property`: Specifies the aspect of the element to be styled.
- `value`: Determines the styling property's value.

## Inline, Internal, and External CSS

There are three methods of including CSS in web documents:

1. **Inline CSS**: Applied directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue text.</p>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS**: Placed within a `<style>` element in the HTML document's `<head>` section.

   Example:
   ```html
   <style>
     p {
       color: green;
     }
   </style>
   ```

3. **External CSS**: Stored in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` element.

   Example:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
   ```

## CSS Rules Cascade

CSS rules cascade, meaning that when conflicting styles are present, the browser determines which style to apply based on specificity and inheritance. Understanding how this works is crucial for effective CSS development.

## Browser Developer Tools

Browser developer tools are essential for debugging and inspecting CSS. You can access them in popular web browsers like Chrome and Firefox to analyze and modify styles on live web pages.

In the next chapter, we'll explore CSS selectors and properties in more detail.
