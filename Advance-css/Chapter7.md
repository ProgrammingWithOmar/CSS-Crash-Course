# Chapter 7: Flexbox

## Introduction to Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. It can distribute space dynamically among items to align and adjust them within a container.

## Flex Container and Flex Item Properties
- `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;` to define a flex container.
- `flex-direction` to define the main axis.
- `justify-content` to align items on the main axis.
- `align-items` to align items on the cross axis.
- `flex-wrap` to set whether items will wrap onto multiple lines.

## Creating Flexible Layouts with flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
- `flex-grow` defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.
- `flex-shrink` defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
- `flex-basis` defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.

## Alignment and Justification
- Aligning single items with `align-self`.
- Justifying multiple items with `justify-content`.
- Aligning multiple items with `align-items` and `align-content`.

Remember to include visual examples and practice exercises to help learners understand the power of Flexbox.
