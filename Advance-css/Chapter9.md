# Chapter 9: Transitions and Animations

Transitions and animations are powerful tools in CSS that bring interactivity and visual appeal to your web designs. In this chapter, we'll explore how to use CSS to create smooth transitions and eye-catching animations.

## CSS Transitions

CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration when a triggering event occurs, such as a hover or click. Commonly transitioned properties include `color`, `background-color`, `width`, and `height`.

```css
/* Apply a transition effect to a button on hover */
button {
  background-color: #0077cc;
  color: #fff;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #005299;
}
```

## CSS Animations

CSS animations provide more advanced control over element animations. You can define keyframes to specify intermediate animation steps and use the `animation` property to apply them. Animations can loop, reverse, and be timed with precision.

```css
/* Create a spinning animation */
@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

.spin {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
```

## Transition vs. Animation

Transitions are typically used for simple, one-off interactions, like button hover effects. Animations are better suited for complex and continuous animations, such as loading spinners or character animations.

## CSS Timing Functions

Timing functions control the speed curve of animations and transitions. Common timing functions include `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`. You can also create custom timing functions using the `cubic-bezier` function.

```css
/* Apply a custom timing function to an animation */
.element {
  animation: slide-in 2s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.27, 1.55);
}
```

## CSS Animation Properties

CSS animation properties include:

- **animation-name**: Specifies the name of the keyframe animation.
- **animation-duration**: Sets the duration of the animation.
- **animation-timing-function**: Defines the timing function.
- **animation-delay**: Delays the start of the animation.
- **animation-iteration-count**: Sets the number of times the animation repeats.
- **animation-direction**: Controls the direction of the animation (normal, reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse).

## Practical Examples

Let's explore practical examples of transitions and animations in CSS:

1. **Fading In Elements on Page Load**:

   ```css
   /* Fade in elements when the page loads */
   .fade-in {
     opacity: 0;
     animation: fade 1s ease-in-out forwards;
   }

   @keyframes fade {
     0% { opacity: 0; }
     100% { opacity: 1; }
   }
   ```

2. **Creating a Loading Spinner**:

   ```css
   /* Style a loading spinner animation */
   .spinner {
     border: 4px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
     border-top: 4px solid #0077cc;
     border-radius: 50%;
     width: 40px;
     height: 40px;
     animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
   }
   ```

Transitions and animations add depth and engagement to your web designs. By mastering these techniques, you can create visually appealing and interactive websites. In the next chapter, we'll explore CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements for more advanced styling.
